# Flask Todo App with MongoDB

This is a simple Flask web application that allows users to manage a todo list. The application utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and retrieve todo items efficiently. Users can view their todos, add new ones, mark them as complete, delete completed todos, and delete all todos.


## Features

- **View Todos:** Visit the main page to see your list of todos.

- **Add Todo:** Use the "Add Todo" form to add new items to your todo list.

- **Complete Todo:** Click on a todo item to mark it as complete.

- **Delete Completed:** Remove all completed todo items from your list.

- **Delete All:** Clear your entire todo list.

## MongoDB Integration
